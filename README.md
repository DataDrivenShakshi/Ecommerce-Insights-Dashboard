  ##Process
- Import Data: Load data from sources like Excel, SQL databases, or cloud services into Power BI using built-in connectors.
-Transform Data: Use Power Query to clean and transform data, such as removing duplicates, handling nulls, and merging tables.
-Model Data: Define relationships between tables (e.g., customer, product, and sales data) and create measures using DAX for key metrics (total sales, profit, etc.).
-Create Visuals: Add various visuals (bar charts, line charts, pie charts, KPI cards, etc.) to represent key data points (e.g., monthly sales, top customers, popular categories).
-Customize Layout: Arrange visuals logically, apply consistent formatting, and add slicers for interactivity (e.g., filtering by state, category, month).
